# GettingAndCleaningData

This repo is for the John Hopkins University Data Science Specialization, Getting and Cleaning Data, Week 4 Course Project.  It contains the R code, codebook and tidey data set for the project.  This repo contains the following files:

- codebook.md - this files describes the data, code and the work that was done to clean and prepare the data.

- run_analysis.R - this is the code that was written to address the 5 steps of the project.  Those steps are:
  1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- TidyDataSet.txt - this is the tidy data set that was the output from step 5.
